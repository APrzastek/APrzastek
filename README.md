##**Hi! I`m Anna Przastek.**

<p>I like to code things from scratch and enjoy bringing ideas to life in the browser. I look for creative ways to push the boundaries of website front-end code without compromising on browser support and performance. I`m a person with high attention to details. I`m highly-motivated, result oriented, self-driven and hard-working person.
I`m familiar with **HTML5, CSS (Bootstrap, Fundation,Sass, Less), JavaScript ES6 (obj,asynch,func), Node.js (npm), Jquery**. 
I`m fast learner and I`m open for constructive opinions/advice. </p>
<br>
<p> I`m currently learning and exercise my skills in React and Vue. In future I want to be a full-stack.</p>

<p>I have also serious passion for UX/UI so its very important for me to make not only responsive websites but also user friendly apps.
I`m interested in designing meaningful experiences that shape how we interact with technology. I always strive to be a better designer by contantly challenging myself. 
I believe in design thinking. I see product design as a process of creative problem solvingwhich always put user goals and needs in the center.
I`m familiar with Adobe XD, Sketch, Figma,Invision, Balsamic, User Accessibility, Bussiness UX and also with fundamentals of Psychology and Marketing.</p>

<p>Few years ago before I made my road-map of Front-end Development and UX/UI design, I started to work as a freelancer in graphic design. I make paintings (almost all are sold out!) and digital art. Meanwhile I also started to design logos, brochures, etc. 
Art mean freedom to me. My work is my passion and I know how to mix front-end, ux/ui and graphic design. When I design graphically, there is always a reason behind every color, typeface, layout, and mark that I make. I believe there are an infinite amount of outcomes to a design problem and I enjoy navigating through the problem to find one of the best solutions. Take a look at my works and I hope that you enjoy some of my ideas. (https://www.behance.net/annaprzastek1 , instagram @im_anna.p)</p>
