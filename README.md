<h2><strong>Hi! I`m Anna Przastek.</strong></h2>

<p>I like to code things from scratch and enjoy bringing ideas to life in the browser. I look for creative ways to push the boundaries of website front-end code without compromising on browser support and performance. I`m a person with high attention to details. I`m highly-motivated, result oriented, self-driven and hard-working person.
I`m familiar with <strong>HTML5, CSS (Bootstrap, Fundation,Sass, Less), React, JavaScript ES6 (oop,asynch,func), Node.js, npm, Jquery, Webpack, MongoDB, Typescript, Gulp, Babel, Git</strong>. 
I`m fast learner and I`m open for constructive opinions/advice. </p>
<br>
<p> I`m currently learning and exercise my skills in Angular,Vue and Python. In future I want to be a full-stack and designer.</p>
<p>I have also serious passion for UX/UI so its very important for me to make not only responsive websites but also user friendly apps.
I`m interested in designing meaningful experiences that shape how we interact with technology. I always strive to be a better designer by contantly challenging myself. 
I believe in design thinking. I see product design as a process of creative problem solving which always put user goals and needs in the center.
I`m familiar with <strong>Adobe XD, Sketch, Figma,Invision, Balsamic, User Accessibility, Bussiness UX and also with fundamentals of Psychology and Marketing</strong>.</p>
<p>Few years ago before I made my road-map of Front-end Development and UX/UI design, I started to work as a freelancer in graphic design. I make paintings (almost all are sold out!) and digital art. Meanwhile I also started to design logos, brochures, etc. 
Art mean freedom to me. My work is my passion and I know how to mix front-end, ux/ui and graphic design. When I design graphically, there is always a reason behind every color, typeface, layout, and mark that I make. I believe there are an infinite amount of outcomes to a design problem and I enjoy navigating through the problem to find one of the best solutions. Take a look at my works and I hope that you enjoy some of my ideas.
